For the 4th and the final task of my Graphic Design Internship at SkillCraft Technology, I was to design a magazine cover of my choice.

I came up with an imaginary magazine, Serene which captures the beauty of health and humans. I drew inspiration from the beauty of the outdoors and wanted to create something that reflects nature and sustainability. It was a rewarding design process, and I enjoyed experimenting with different layouts and elements to bring the concept to life.

Wrapping up this little gig and looking forward to new stuff!
